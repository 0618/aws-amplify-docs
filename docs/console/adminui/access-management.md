With the Admin UI, team members with different job functions can collaborate on a project deployed in the Amplify Console. Admin UI developers can create accounts with scoped access to resources and invite members to join vial email. Members with *Full access* can create and manage AWS resources, while members with *Manage only* access can edit application content and users.

Use the following instructions to add and manage team members and their access to a project.
