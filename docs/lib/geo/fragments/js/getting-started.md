> Prerequisite: [Install and configure the Amplify CLI](~/cli/start/install.md)

## Provisioning resources

The primary way to provision Geo resources is through the Amplify CLI. Currently, Amplify Geo is in developer preview and you need to install the CLI with the `@geo` tag. You can use the following command to install this version globally.

```sh
npm i -g @aws-amplify/cli@geo
```

Now, let's make sure that the right version was installed:

```sh
amplify --version
```

That should show a version with the `-geo.x` tag, for example, `5.2.2-geo.0`

Once that is complete, you can run the following command from your project's root folder to add a `geo` resource:

```sh
amplify add geo
```

The CLI will prompt configuration options for the Geo category such as what type of capability you want to add (maps and search) and default or advanced settings.

The add command automatically creates the backend configuration. Once all your configuration is complete run the following:

```sh
amplify push
```

A file called `aws-exports.js` that contains all geo-related configuration information is placed in your app's source directory.

For more information, you can visit the full [Amplify CLI Geo Maps docs](~/cli/geo/maps.md).

## Configure your app

Install the necessary dependencies by running the following command:

```sh
npm install aws-amplify@geo
```

Import and load the configuration file generated in previous step using Amplify CLI in your app. It’s recommended you add the Amplify configuration step to your app’s root entry point. For example `App.js` in React or `main.ts` in Angular or Ionic.

```javascript
import Amplify from 'aws-amplify';
import awsconfig from './aws-exports';
Amplify.configure(awsconfig);
```

### Manual configuration - Using existing Amazon Location Service resources

You can also use Amplify Geo with your existing Amazon Location Service resources if you'd like, there's just some manual setup that you need to do.

To configure Geo manually, you will have to configure Amplify Auth category as well. In other words, you will not be importing the autogenerated `aws-exports.js` - instead, you will be adding your own existing Amazon Cognito and Amazon Location Service credentials in your app like this:

```
import Amplify, { Auth, Geo } from 'aws-amplify';

Amplify.configure({
  Auth: {
    identityPoolId: 'XX-XXXX-X:XXXXXXXX-XXXX-1234-abcd-1234567890ab', // REQUIRED - Amazon Cognito Identity Pool ID
    region: 'XX-XXXX-X', // REQUIRED - Amazon Cognito Region
    userPoolId: 'XX-XXXX-X_abcd1234', // OPTIONAL - Amazon Cognito User Pool ID for authenticated user access
    userPoolWebClientId: 'XX-XXXX-X_abcd1234', // OPTIONAL - Amazon Cognito Web Client ID for authenticated user access
  },
  Geo: {
    AmazonLocationService: {
      maps: {
        items: {
          "XXXXXXXXXXX": { // REQUIRED - Amazon Location Service Map resource name
            style: "VectorEsriStreets", // REQUIRED - String representing the style of map resource
          },
        },
        default: "XXXXXXXXXXX", // REQUIRED - Amazon Location Service Map resource name to set as default
      },
      search_indices: {
        items: ["XXXXXXXXX"], // REQUIRED - Amazon Location Service Place Index name
        default: "XXXXXXXXX", // REQUIRED - Amazon Location Service Place Index name to set as default
      },
      region: 'XX-XXXX-X', // REQUIRED - Amazon Location Service Region
    },
  },
})
```

If you set up your Cognito resources manually, the roles will need to be given permission to access the map and place indices.

There are two roles created by Cognito: an `Auth_Role` that grants signed-in-user-level access and an `Unauth_Role` that allows unauthenticated access to resources. Attach the corresponding policies to each role for proper access. Replace ```{enter Map/PlaceIndex name}``` with the correct resource names.

Add the following policy for both the `Auth_Role` and `Unauth_Role`:

```json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Sid": "GetTiles",
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": [
        "geo:GetMapTile",
        "geo:GetMapSprites",
        "geo:GetMapGlyphs",
        "geo:GetMapStyleDescriptor"
      ],
      "Resource": "arn:aws:geo:us-west-2:{account-id}:map/{enter Map name}"
    },
    {
      "Sid": "Search",
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": [
        "geo:SearchPlaceIndexForPosition",
        "geo:SearchPlaceIndexForText"
      ],
      "Resource": "arn:aws:geo:us-west-2:{account-id}:place-index/{enter PlaceIndex name}"
    }
  ]
}
```
