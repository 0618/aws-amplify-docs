Many applications have UX with Guest or "Unauthenticated" users. This functionality is supported out of the box with `AWSMobileClient` through the initialization routine you have added. However, the Amplify CLI does not enable this by default with the `amplify add auth` flow. You can enable this by running `amplify update auth` and choosing `Manual Configuration` when prompted. Ensure you choose the **User Sign-Up, Sign-In, connected with AWS IAM controls** which will allow you to select **Allow unauthenticated logins**.

When complete run `amplify push` to update your backend and the `awsconfiguration.json` which will work automatically with the updated settings. The `AWSMobileClient` user session will automatically have permissions configured for Guest users upon initialization. 

If you login in your app either using the [Drop-In Auth](/sdk/auth/drop-in-auth?platform=ios) or the [direct Auth APIs](/sdk/auth/working-with-api?platform=ios) then the `AWSMobileClient` user session will transition to an authenticated role.
