The AWS Mobile SDKs for iOS and Android enable you to build mobile apps by providing simplified APIs for AWS services such as Amazon Cognito, Amazon S3, AWS AppSync and more.

## How are these different from the Amplify Libraries for iOS and Android?
The Amplify client libraries are use-case centric as compared to the Mobile SDKs which are service-centric. For most AWS services, the Mobile SDKs are auto-generated while the Amplify libraries are completely hand authored providing a highly abstracted category based programming model. 	You can also use the Mobile SDKs with the Amplify libraries using escape hatches if the use case you are trying to build is not available in Amplify libraries.
