? Which site do you want to open?
    `Amplify Console`

This should open your web browser and take you to your amplify backend. On this page:
1. Click the **Go to Admin UI Management to enable** link

2. On the following page, turn the switch on for **Enable admin UI (All environments)**

3. When the backend deployment is complete, select the radio button next to the **Environment name** of the environment you want to manage (there is most likely only one at this time) and click **Open Admin UI**
