  title: `Override Amplify-generated project-level IAM resources`,
  description: `The "amplify override storage" command generates a developer-configurable "overrides" TypeScript file which provides Amplify-generated IAM roles for authenticated and unauthenticated access deployed as part of an Amplify backend's root CloudFormation stack. For example, developers can run "amplify override project" to change the authenticated and unauthenticated IAM role names to comply with organization-specific naming conventions.`,
