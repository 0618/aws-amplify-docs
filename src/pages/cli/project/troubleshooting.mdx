## Description
This Troubleshooting Guide is intended to provide high level guidance to developers in the detection and correction of errors encountered during development, deployment and migration of applications built using the amplify-cli. This guide may also be useful for on-call engineers to assist customers encountering issues.This guide attempts to describe the most common and critical problems encountered by amplify-cli customers and is continuously updated to refer the latest documentation. 

## Essential Reading
### Amplify CLI Project 
If you need to debug any deployment issues in an Amplify CLI generated project, it’s helpful to understand the [file structure of your project](https://docs.amplify.aws/cli/reference/files/) using the CLI documentation. In addition to this, it would be helpful to understand the various artifacts generated by the Amplify CLI.
1. Understanding Amplify CloudFormation artifacts: The Amplify CLI provisions AWS resources using [CloudFormation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/Welcome.html) (compiled to templates) and input parameters provided by the developer during the CLI walkthrough process. In Amplify CLI ^7.x, some categories (Storage, Auth, API) allow developers to change the configuration of the CLI generated cloud resources using the [Amplify CLI Overrides feature](https://docs.amplify.aws/cli/project/override/).
2. Understanding Amplify CLI Input Params artifacts: All user provided inputs are stored in JSON files in the /amplify/backend folder e.g. cli-inputs.json, amplify-meta.json. This information is critical when debugging any failures as they let you inspect the configurations (both developer provided and Amplify CLI generated) to root cause the problem. Please refer to the list of [Amplify Backend Files](https://docs.amplify.aws/cli/reference/files/#backend-configjson) to ascertain if it’s safe to edit them or not.

### Amplify GraphQL API
If you need to debug any deployment issues in Amplify projects with GraphQL API, please refer to the following documentation:
#### Understanding Amplify GraphQL artifacts: 
The Amplify CLI GraphQL workflow helps generate AWS AppSync infrastructure resources (API definitions, schema, resolvers) and client-side code. Running amplify api gql-compile and [amplify codegen](https://docs.amplify.aws/cli-legacy/graphql-transformer/codegen/#amplify-add-codegen) prior to running amplify push may help developers to validate their GraphQL schemas and avoid getting amplify push failures. Please refer to the [Amplify GraphQL Troubleshooting guide](https://docs.amplify.aws/cli/graphql/troubleshooting/) .
  * GraphQL schema VTL generation: The Amplify CLI GraphQL workflow uses the [AWS AppSync service](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/appsync/latest/devguide/system-overview-and-architecture.html) to provision the GraphQL API. The “amplify api gql-compile” command transpiles the GraphQL schema provided by the developer and generates all the artifacts required to deploy the API in AWS. 
    *	Directives in the GraphQL schema are used to generate CloudFormation and provision AWS resources like AWS DynamoDB for resolving [@model](https://docs.amplify.aws/cli/graphql/data-modeling/), AWS Lambda for [@function](https://docs.amplify.aws/cli-legacy/graphql-transformer/function/) resolvers, AWS Cognito for [@auth](https://docs.amplify.aws/cli-legacy/graphql-transformer/auth/#auth), AWS OpenSearch for [@searchable](https://docs.amplify.aws/cli-legacy/graphql-transformer/searchable/#definition).
    *	The GraphQL resolvers for Query, Mutation or Subscription are converted into [VTL (Velocity Template Language)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/appsync/latest/devguide/resolver-mapping-template-reference-programming-guide.html) files. AWS AppSync uses VTL to translate GraphQL requests from clients into a request to your data source.
  * GraphQL schema Client-Side Code generation: The Amplify CLI GraphQL workflow allows developers to generate client side code for web and mobile clients using the amplify codegen command. 

## Further Reading
The [AWS Knowledge Center](https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/knowledge-center/) provides a deep dive and prescriptive guidance for building and managing scalable. For debugging Amplify deployed services, the sections for AppSync, API Gateway, DynamoDB are highly recommended. 

## Troubleshooting Amplify CLI Push Failures
<Callout information>
Error Messages: “An error occurred during the push operation”
</Callout>

The [`amplify push`](https://docs.amplify.aws/cli/start/workflows/#amplify-push) command performs the following steps before completing successfully such as the following in the case of a project using a GraphQL API:

1. Generate CloudFormation for deployment of resources to AWS.
2. Generate VTL & associated CloudFormation for the GraphQL API by running amplify api gql-compile. 
3. Build packages and upload the deployment artifacts into the application's deployment bucket. 
4. It then uses the AWS CloudFormation SDK to deploy the CloudFormation stack into the deployment account.
5. On a successful deployment of the resources to AWS, the Amplify CLI copies the deployment package in the name #current-cloud-backend.zip. This file is the source of truth for your deployment. Hence even if your local folder gets deleted or corrupted, you can always go back to your “last successful deployment” using the [`amplify pull`](https://docs.amplify.aws/cli/start/workflows/#amplify-pull) command.

The following section shows some examples on how to debug `amplify push` failures: 

### Handling Push Failures from Manual Changes to Cloud Resources - Drift 
<Callout warning>
Warning** 
Once an application is deployed to the cloud using Amplify CLI the cloud resources like DynamoDB tables, Cognito Roles, IAM policies should never be updated manually from the AWS console of the services. 
</Callout>

The Amplify CLI cannot track manual changes applied to the resources through the AWS console and hence subsequent deployment to the cloud may fail. This state of the system where the actual resource state diverges from the CloudFormation stack is known as “CloudFormation Drift”. Currently there is no automated process to revert the system back to the earlier state and hence each resource has to be inspected through the AWS console for “Drift” in its CloudFormation stack and the “Drift” has to be reversed manually.
Assume, you have created a GraphQL schema in Amplify with multiple models which results in the creation of AppSync API models, resolvers and multiple DynamoDB tables and GSIs. 

#### Scenario:1 Amplify Push fails after manually updating DynamoDB tables and GSIs.
Assume a situation where you have renamed GraphQL [@model](https://docs.amplify.aws/cli/graphql/data-modeling/)s in your Amplify CLI project and updated their [@index](https://docs.amplify.aws/cli/graphql/data-modeling/) parameters. 
However, at this point you use the DynamoDB console in your account to delete multiple [GSIs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/GSI.html) belonging to the Amplify application which belonged to the older model names. 
This action will introduce a “CloudFormation Drift” in the CloudFormation stack deployed by Amplify. Since the GSIs corresponding to the older DynamoDB tables are deleted, any change to index parameters will fail and hence deployment of the stack may fail. 
##### Suggested Resolution: 
When the system is in a drifted state, the prescribed way to fix deployment failures is to first rollback the state of the drifted resource manually to match its state in CloudFormation and then retry `amplify push`.
1. You can view the drift in the DynamoDB CloudFormation Stack per instructions in the [AWS Drift Detection document](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/detect-drift-stack.html)
2. Revert every drift manually through the AWS console. In this particular scenario, re-create the GSIs and manually undo any renaming changes.
3. Perform an amplify push. 

#### Scenario:2 Amplify push fails after manually updating (non database) resources in the cloud, for example if the failure is seen in any of the following situations
* You have manually updated your GraphQL schema using the AppSync console. Or
* You have manually deleted user pools from the Cognito console. Or
* You have updated the code in lambda functions which were originally deployed through Amplify. 
##### Suggested Resolution:
These types of drift need to be addressed on a case-by-case basis as the types of changes. In some cases, e.g. lambda code change, forcing a redeployment of the function by making a minor change to the code may work. In other cases, like deleting user pools or updates to GraphQL schema from the AppSync console please try the following steps. 
1. Forcible deployment of CloudFormation stack from the CLI - Run amplify push --force to force push the application’s resource stack to be deployed.
2. Forcible deployment of CloudFormation stack from the Console - Fetch the CloudFormation stack from the application’s deployment bucket and selectively run the resource specific part of the stack through the CloudFormation console.
3. Apply drift changes into code: If both the above methods to deploy CloudFormation have failed for you, the other option is to inspect the manual changes and to update them in the CLI input files. For example, you could update the GraphQL schema to reflect the same changes as performed manually in the cloud. 

### Handling Push Failures in a Multi-Environment Project (CI/CD bootstrapping errors)
In a Multi Environment project with CI/CD, if you find that the application is deployed correctly in one environment, but fails in another environment. Some of the probable causes are
1. Some resource being referenced in the CloudFormation is missing from the failing account. 
2. The failing account has no permission to access a particular resource used in the CloudFormation. 
3. The application code relies on “secrets” and secrets are not correctly created or copied in the failing environment.
Here, you would want to debug the failing environment and root cause the problem.
Assume, you have created a project in a “Demo” environment and are planning to expand it to a full CI/CD environment with Dev, Test and Prod, your project most probably follows a pattern specified in the [Amplify Teams guide](https://docs.amplify.aws/cli/teams/overview/#setting-up-prod-and-dev-environments). However on completion of all steps you observe that Amplify studio displays the “build” step of one of your stages as failed and others as successfully deployed.
##### Suggested Resolution: 
If your application uses secrets, please refer to https://docs.amplify.aws/cli/function/secrets/#accessing-the-values-in-your-function in the multi-env section to debug any issues related to secrets not being correctly copied across environments. 
For debugging other problems, please use the amplify cli to deploy the application in the failing account using the following steps
1. amplify pull --appId successfulEnvAppID --envName successfulEnv
2. amplify env checkout failingEnv
3. amplify push 

If the push fails, please check the CloudFormation event logs for the failing resource to get detailed information and use this to fix issues in the environment. Visit the CloudFormation service console and search for you application name. e.g. An application named lil deployed in the beta environment would have a CloudFormation stack named amplify-lil-beta-{random chars}. Click on stack name and the Resources tab to view the status and the error reason.
This figure displays the CloudFormation status logs for a failed resource deployed through Amplify CLI:

### Handling push failures from: Application resources hitting AWS Service Limits
<Callout information>
Error Messages: 
"Limit on the number of resources in a single stack operation exceeded” 
"Cannot exceed quota for PoliciesPerRole"
</Callout>

AWS maintains service quotas (formerly called service limits) for each account to help guarantee the availability of AWS resources and prevent accidental provisioning of more resources than needed. If your application contains many resources, especially for particularly big GraphQL schemas with complex connections and resolvers or REST APIs with many resolvers, it’s likely that you might eventually hit AWS Service Limits leading to amplify push failures. 
To identify if a push failure is because of exceeding [AWS Service level quotas](https://console.aws.amazon.com/servicequotas) please check the AWS console for the CloudFormation deployment/failure logs.

##### Suggested Resolution: 
1. If the bug is related to hitting service-quotas, you can use AWS Service Quotas console to view and request increases for most AWS quotas.
2. If your application uses Amplify DataStore, some resource limits may affect deployment. Referring the [Amplify DataStore Best Practices](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/whitepapers/latest/amplify-datastore-implementation/amplify-datastore-best-practices.html) document may provide insights into making the correct design decisions to help resolve these types of issues. 
3. If the service quotas cannot be increased, then this may require you to redesign some aspects of your application for sustainable running in a serverless environment. Referring to [AWS Knowledge Center](https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/knowledge-center/) may help understand the different prescribed design changes, for example, A complex GraphQL schema could be simplified to reduce the number of GraphQL resources in use e.g Collapsing Models, Composite Keys, Lambda resolvers. Using escape hatches like overrides and export may help to scale the application beyond the CLI generated architecture. 

###### Example 1: Optimizing REST API schema for reducing policy count:
Assume you have deployed a REST API using Amplify CLI with 3 routes and one lambda to handle all routes.
Amplify CLI in this case generates one policy per route and applies it to the lambda execution role. A configuration with 20 or more routes has the likelihood of hitting the “Max policies per role” limit per [AWS IAM limits](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/reference_iam-limits.html). 

|Resources	|Policies|	Role|	Handler|
|-|-|-|-|
|/items/rock|	amplify generated policy1	| | |
|/items/paper| amplify generated policy2 |Execution Role Lambda| Lambda function |
|/items/scissors|	amplify generated policy3 || |		

However, if your application has many routes, one way to reduce the number of policies generated could be by creating a single resource with parameterization of the paths:
`/items?item=rock, /items?item=paper, /items?item=scissors` 
In this case the Amplify CLI creates only 1 policy for the /items resource.

|Resources	|Policies|	Role|	Handler|
|-|-|-|-|
|/items| amplify generated policy	| Execution Role Lambda | Lambda function |

### Handling push failures from: GraphQL Schema Syntax Errors
Tag: “Schema validation failed”, “Unknown directive”, “invalid directive”
After making any GraphQL schema changes, please run amplify api gql-compile to ensure that the schema is correctly formed and amplify is able to generate valid CloudFormation from the GraphQL schema. Please refer the [Amplify CLI GraphQL(v2) Documentation](https://docs.amplify.aws/cli-legacy/graphql-transformer/overview/) to understand the latest Amplify GraphQL directives.
###### Example:
Assume your GraphQL schema has an error where the directive @model is misspelt as @mode:
```graphql
type Tag @mode { /** @mode is an invalid directive **/
  id : ID!
  tag: String
  topics: [Topic]
}
```

On running gql-compile the transform step will fail with an invalid directive.

### Troubleshooting other GraphQL schema related errors 
If amplify push fails while deploying any of the below mentioned operations, please refer to the [Amplify GraphQL Troubleshooting Guide](https://docs.amplify.aws/cli/graphql/troubleshooting/).
1.	[Deploying multiple index changes in a single amplify push](https://docs.amplify.aws/cli/graphql/troubleshooting/#deploying-multiple-index-changes-at-once)
2.	[Backfill OpenSearch index from DynamoDB table](https://docs.amplify.aws/cli/graphql/troubleshooting/#deploying-multiple-index-changes-at-once)
3.	[Index with Multi-Sort Key Fields](https://docs.amplify.aws/cli/graphql/troubleshooting/#index-with-multiple-sort-key-fields)

## Deployment Best Practices
This section describes the commonly followed best practices which help developers avoid deployment errors and scaling problems.
### Overriding Amplify CLI Behavior 
The Amplify CLI follows a unidirectional data flow. Any changes to your application must be performed only through the Amplify CLI and the associated configuration files or through Amplify Studio. You should never manually edit any resources directly from the AWS console or using the AWS CLI/SDK, unless the Amplify documentation explains that it’s necessary to achieve something. If you wish to override the default behavior of Amplify CLI generated resources, you should follow the instructions in the [Amplify extensibility documentation](https://docs.amplify.aws/cli/#extensibility) which details all the “escape hatches” available in the Amplify CLI framework. 

### Changing Model Names in the GraphQL Schema
<Callout information>
Error Messages: “An error occurred during the push operation: Removing a model from the GraphQL schema will also remove the underlying DynamoDB table”, “ALL EXISTING DATA IN THESE TABLES WILL BE LOST!”
</Callout>

If you've previously pushed the schema to the cloud and then rename the table in the schema, then the subsequent push will fail and require you to pass `—allow-destructive-graphql-schema-updates`. This flag will result in the deletion of the backing dynamo table for the old model and subsequent creation of the tables with the new model names. The exception to this is the new @mapsTo directive which has not released yet, allowing you to preserve data. 
###### Example 1: The following scenario shows the error displayed by the Amplify CLI when you try to push a schema change to the cloud (for an already deployed table). 

###### fig.1.3 Amplify GraphQL Model Deletion Warning/Error
![ts-guide-model-deletion-warning](/images/ts-guide-model-deletion-warning.png)

### Migration from GraphQL Transformer V1 to GraphQL Transformer V2
If you have previously deployed an application using GraphQL Transformer V1 and have decided to migrate to GraphQL transformer V2 , please go through the [GraphQL Transformer migration document](https://docs.amplify.aws/cli/migration/transformer-migration/#changes-that-amplify-cli-will-auto-migrate-for-you) to understand the impact of the migration on the schema directives and limitations prior to updating. 

### Local Testing 
Test schema changes and business logic as much as you can prior to deployment, amplify mock allows validate your cloud dependencies locally. It’s easier to find a bug locally and fix it than it is to fix cloud resources that have been put in a bad state. Follow the mock testing examples in [Advanced Workflows document](https://docs.amplify.aws/cli/usage/mock/) to dive deeper.
