Use [Amplify Theme Editor](https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/1040722185526429545/AWS-Amplify-Theme-Editor) to customize the UI primitives in your Figma file to match your brand's look and feel. Amplify Studio allows you to visually configure the [Amplify UI theme](https://ui.docs.amplify.aws/theming) definition.

## Amplify Theme Editor

All theme edits in your Figma file are made with the [Amplify Theme Editor](https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/1040722185526429545/AWS-Amplify-Theme-Editor).

### Install Amplify Theme Editor (Figma plugin)

To install the Amplify Theme Editor:
1. Go to the [Amplify Theme Editor Figma plugin page](https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/1040722185526429545/AWS-Amplify-Theme-Editor)
2. Click "Install" on the top-right corner
3. Go to your Figma file
4. Right-click anywhere and select **Plugins** > **Amplify Theme Editor**

### 1. Modify brand colors

Select your own brand color or choose a preset. Your brand color affects almost every single UI primitive and allows you to quickly modify your components look and feel to match your brand.

Amplify Theme Editor will automatically cascade color levels 10 - 100. You can modify the auto-generated levels further by selecting the level and tweaking the HEX or HSL values to your exact specification.

### 2. Use brand colors in Figma

Every color listed in the Amplify Theme Editor is also available as a Figma color style. In the example below, I can choose any frame and assign the fill to my brand color with level 10.

### 3. Use space definitions in Figma

Each Amplify UI theme contains definitions for spacing such as "small", "large", or "xl". You can define the spacing scale within the "Space" tab in the Amplify Theme Editor.

To apply spacing tokens to your own components:
1. Open the Amplify Theme Editor
2. Click on the "Apply" tab
3. Select a frame
4. Configure it as a reference by entering `{space.<SPACING_TOKEN>}`. For example: `{space.small}`
5. Click "Update theme"

### 3. Modify UI primitive colors

Individual primitives such as Alerts have their own bindings for color to fine-tune their look and feel as well. This is especially useful as you start defining colors for states such as "sucess", "warning", "error", or "info".

To change colors of UI primitives:
1. Open the Amplify Theme Editor
2. Click on the "Component" tab
3. Select the value you want to edit. For example: `components.badge.error.backgroundColor`
4. Choose a new color
5. Click "Update theme"

### 4. Modify color palette

Similar to brand colors, Amplify provides out-of-the-box a color palette that you can use as a starting point. You can reference all of these colors as well via color styles in Figma.
